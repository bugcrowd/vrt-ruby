# Contributing
Bugcrowd welcomes community feedback and direct contributions to the Bugcrowd VRT Ruby Wrapper. We accept comments for public discussion via GitHub Issues.

## Process
Please open your feedback as an **Issue** and label it as either a `bug` or an `enhancement`. Large or systemic changes should first be discussed in an Issue rather than be submitted as a pull request directly.

Prior to opening a pull request please ensure your suggested changes pass specs. The repository uses [`rspec`](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) for spec running, run it with `bundle install && bundle exec rspec`.

### Updating the VRT version
When a new version of the VRT is released, we follow these steps:
1. Add new submodule of the new version tag
    - `git submodule add git@github.com:bugcrowd/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy.git lib/data/X.X`
    - `cd lib/data/X.X`
    - `git checkout vX.X`
2. Release a new version of the gem (see below)
3. Update dependent applications
    - `bundle update vrt`

### Releasing new versions of the gem
1. Merge all PRs targeted for inclusion in the release (without touching `version.rb`)
2. Bump the version in `version.rb`
3. Commit the version bump `git commit -m [tag name]` (where `tag name` is something like `v0.8.0`)
4. Tag the commit `git tag [tag name]` (where `tag name` is something like `v0.8.0`)
5. Push the tag and the commit `git push origin master --tag` 
6. Run `rake release`


If you need access to push the gem, create an account on rubygems (if you don't have one already) and then ask one of the existing owners to runÂ `gem owner vrt --add <your-rubygems-email>`
